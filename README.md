## Preparation

### Environment Setup
To ensure compatibility and smooth execution, the following libraries and frameworks are required:
- **PyTorch**
- **TorchAudio**
- **DeepOD**


---
## Train and Validatation

### Set the Configuration  
Edit the configuration file located at: `config/config.json`  

### Train the Network  
Run the following command to train the model:  
```bash
python MSVDD_train.py
```  

### Evaluate the Network  
After training, evaluate the model's performance using:`MSVDD_test.ipynb`

### Dataset
- The dataset used in this repository can be downloaded from [this link](https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/yizhuo001_e_ntu_edu_sg/EbQAP08fM_5LvZqfEVBX7BUBNH7RfH1T1OE26DDRPsigow?e=gmIETT).  
- The ROS bag containing all modality data will be uploaded soon.

---
## Note
- The evaluation of the model on public datasets are presented in timeseries branch or [this link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GSVDD-853B).
